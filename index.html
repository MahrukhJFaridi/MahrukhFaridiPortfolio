									<h2>MS Excel Project</h2>
									<h3>Europe Bike Sales Analysis</h3>
									<p>This MS Excel project meticulously analyzed the trends of Bike Sales in Europe based on European Demographics, beginning with thorough data cleansing with Excel functions and formulas to ensure accuracy. Leveraging Excel's pivot tables, we organized and summarized the data, unveiling insightful trends and patterns. Utilizing dynamic charting tools, we visually represented sales data, providing clear and concise insights. Finally, we crafted an interactive dashboard, offering a comprehensive overview of the sales landscape.</p>

									<h2>SQL Project #1</h2>
									<h3>Global Death Causes Exploratory Data Analysis</h3>
									<p>In my SQL EDA project, I dive deep into the complex landscape of global mortality, leveraging SQL aggregate functions and JOINs to unearth compelling insights. Beginning by identifying countries with the highest death rates attributed to specific diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases in the United States and road accidents in China, I unravel the stark realities shaping mortality patterns worldwide. Utilizing temporary tables and Common Table Expressions (CTEs), I meticulously quantify the escalating risk of succumbing to heart disease in the US from 1990 to 2019. Additionally, I dissect the causes of death across various age demographics, revealing intriguing statistics â€“ from the elderly contributing 20% of heart disease-related deaths to adults comprising 60% of fatalities resulting from road accidents. To streamline future analyses and visualization endeavors, I craft SQL Views to store curated datasets for seamless integration with visualization tools like Tableau.</p>

									<h2>SQL Project #2</h2>
									<h3>Data Cleaning Real Housing Dataset</h3>
									<p>In this SQL project, I focused on cleaning the Tennessee Housing Dataset. The primary objective was to enhance the dataset's quality and reliability for subsequent analysis. The project began with importing the dataset into a SQL database, ensuring proper table structures were in place. Utilizing SQL queries, the dataset was thoroughly examined to identify and address common data cleaning challenges such as null values, inconsistencies, and duplicates. Through strategic use of SQL functions and operations, anomalies are corrected, missing data is filled in where appropriate, and redundant entries are eliminated.</p>

									<h2>MS Power BI Project Dashboard</h2>
									<h3>Wellness and Life-style Survey Breakdown</h3>
									<p>This Power BI project conducts a detailed analysis of a wellness and lifestyle survey involving nearly 16,000 respondents. Through meticulous data scrutiny, it uncovers insightful findings about participants' lives. Notably, it highlights a gender disparity in work-life balance, with women demonstrating a stronger equilibrium between professional and personal spheres compared to men. Moreover, the survey reveals that men experience higher levels of daily stress, with 75% reporting stress compared to 25% of women. Age emerges as a crucial factor shaping behaviors, with older individuals showing a greater inclination towards charitable giving, while the younger demographic engages more with social media. Additionally, the survey unveils a notable aspect of financial satisfaction, with an impressive 80% of respondents expressing contentment with their current salaries.

									<h2>Tableau Project Dashboard</h2>
									<h3>Vehicles Sales Data Analysis</h3>
									<p>
										This Tableau project offers a deep perspective on various aspects by conducting an extensive analysis of automobile sales data. At the forefront, Ford emerges as the dominant player in the automotive market, both in terms of revenue generation and sheer volume of cars sold. One of the key insights presented is the comparison between the average market price of cars and their actual selling prices, shedding light on pricing dynamics and consumer behavior. The dashboard also delves into the preferences of consumers regarding car colors, identifying the hues that are most popular among buyers. State-wise breakdown of market prices provides valuable geographical insights, showcasing regional variations in car pricing trends. Additionally, the dashboard provides a breakdown of car sales by body type, highlighting sedans as the most favored type among consumers.</p>

									<h2>Web Scraping Project Using Python</h2>
									<h3>Extracting World Obesity Data</h3>
									<p>This project focuses on analyzing and extracting world obesity rates for both men and women through web scraping with Pandas. After inspecting the webpage's HTML structure, we meticulously extracted data using Python. Initially, we cleaned and structured the extracted titles, then created a data frame for storage. Utilizing a for loop, we systematically extracted row and column data and inserted it into the data frame. Following the same process, we created a separate data frame for female obesity rates. Finally, we merged both data frames to compile a comprehensive dataset for further analysis.
